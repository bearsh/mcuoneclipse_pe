%include Common\GeneralMethod.inc (SendBlockContinue)
%;**     Description :
%;**         Same is SendBlock() but does not send start condition. When
%;**         working as a MASTER, this method writes 7 bits of slave
%;**         address plus R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and then writes the
%;**         block of characters to the bus. If the component is disabled
%;**         (by the "Disable" method or initialization), the block is
%;**         moved to the output buffer if the 'Output buffer size'
%;**         property is different from zero. The content of the output
%;**         buffer is sent immediately with the stop condition at the
%;**         end when the component is enabled by the "Enable" method.
%;**         After the output buffer transmission, the whole output
%;**         buffer is cleared. The slave address must be specified
%;**         before by the "SelectSlave" method or in component
%;**         initialization section of 'Slave address init' property.
%;**         When working as a SLAVE, this method writes block of
%;**         characters to the bus. If the ERR_NOTAVAIL error code is
%;**         returned, the whole block is successfully sent to a master
%;**         but the master device responds by an acknowledgment instead
%;**         of no acknowledgment sent at the end of the last block byte
%;**         transfer. 'OnError' event is called in this case.
